Installation
============

The WIRC_DRP can be found in a public `Github Repository <https://github.com/WIRC-Pol/wirc_drp>`_. 

There are several dependecies for the pipeline, but if you follow the install instructions on Github then the only one you'll have to install manually is: `image_registration <https://github.com/keflavich/image_registration>`_. Please pay attention to their `citation request <https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_.
