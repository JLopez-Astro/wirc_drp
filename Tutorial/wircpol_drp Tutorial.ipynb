    "# WIRC+POL Data Reduction Tutorial #\n",
    "Welcome to the WIRC+POL data reduction pipeline (DRP) tutorial. The notebook will give you a basic run \n",
    "through of how to reduce WIRC+POL data and give you some details about the setup of the pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline Description ###\n",
    "The pipeline has been designed so that once read-in, each data file will be held in an object called a *wirc_data* object. Each *wircpol_data* object will contain, the raw (or calibrated) 2D data itself, relevant information about the data and a number of functions that will calibrate and process the data. It will also contain a list of *wircpol_source* objects, where each *wircpol_source* will correspond to a source in the field. The source object will contain thumbnails of the spectral traces, as well as the extracted spectrum and polarized spectrum for each source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The current implementation has been designed with WIRC+POL data in mind, but we hope to extent this to WIRC+Spec data soon. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions ###\n",
    "We assume that you have set an environment variable called \"WIRCPOL_DRP\" that points to the base directory of the DRP and that it is in your python path. Beyond the standard python packages we also assume you have astropy installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Tutorial ### \n",
    "This tutorial will give an example of reducing a raw WIRC+POL data image from start to finish, and will give you an idea of the implementation of the pipeline along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 0 - Make your calibration files ##\n",
    "The very first step will be to create your own master darks and master flats. For the sake of this tutorial we well assume that you have done this already, but we provide somed example code commented-out below. Already-made master darks and flats have been provided in the tutorial directory. "
